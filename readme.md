# Art Auction Project 2026

## Project: "Pixel Classroom"

This is an art-meets-computer project.
It is about pixels and representation, referencing video games that have a 'pixel-art' aesthetic, like Minecraft and how that can apply to making self-portraits.
Students will learn about pixels, pixel-art, and game design.

### Outline:
- Discuss, "What is a Pixel?"
- Pixel: short for 'picture element' -- each has a Red, Green, Blue value -- the little dots that make up a screen!
- When put all those dots together, you get an image.
- Has anyone watched a video, or played minecraft or a video game before? Millions of pixels!
- Demo project and examples. 1 pixel, spritesheet (collection of pixel images collated on one larger image), etc.
- Activity: Students make a hand-colored 16x16 "pixel" self-portrait and a hand-colored "pixel" classroom object.
- Parent helpers scan in student artwork with their phones (still being worked on): https://ngolebiewski.github.io/pixel-camera/
- Discuss how to make a game using the students' artwork. i.e. you are in a classroom and have lost your ruler, search around until you find it.


### Art Auction project: A Spritesheet photo print and a classroom created stand-alone video game.
(2 parts)
1. 16x20 (or so) photo print of the 'spritesheet' collecting the students' art
2. A stand alone mini video game, on a tiny touchscreen attached to a Raspberry Pi*, using the art the students made. Runs a demo until someone starts playing.
*Raspberry Pi's are mini single-board-computers that are often used in robotics projects.

### Supplies/Budget:
- Paper printed with four 16x16 grids (no cost, from PTA office)
- Markers (already have?)
- Parent to donate a usb cable and plug
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W: $25
- LCD Screen: $25
- Controller and Misc: $15
- Color photographic Print: $16.80 + $5 Shipping
Total cost $80-$90
